## **Pro Research AI: Premium Academic Engine**

### **📜 Overview**

**Pro Research AI** is a high-fidelity academic tool designed to automate the synthesis of research into professional manuscripts. Unlike basic generators, it mimics the structure of a formal academic paper, integrating live web data with user-provided documents to produce structured, multi-page assignments in seconds.

### **🚀 Key Features**

* **🔍 Multi-Source Synthesis:** Simultaneously scans **Wikipedia** and parses **uploaded files** (PDF, DOCX, TXT) to build a unified context.
* **📑 Multi-Page PDF Formatting:** Generates high-resolution PDFs including a **Professional Cover Page**, **Table of Contents**, and **Structured Sections** (2.1, 2.2, etc.).
* **🎭 Academic Tone Selection:** Allows users to shift the linguistic complexity between **Basic**, **Professional**, and **Deep Research** levels.
* **📚 Auto-Bibliography:** Automatically generates citations and a bibliography section at the end of every report to maintain academic integrity.
* **✨ Glassmorphism UI:** A modern, high-contrast interface designed for maximum readability and a premium user experience.
